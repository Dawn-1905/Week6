        <h3>This advice from Sir Alex is everything! Don't miss it...</h3>
        <p></p>Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has shared his invaluable wisdom with yet another generation of talented young players, gifting them this mantra to live by: “Handle defeat in the right way and make sure you are a winner the next day!”

        Sir Alex spoke to a room full of fledgling talent during the Academy's recent Celebration Event at Old Trafford, as seen by supporters in our new Lifeblood feature 'United at Heart'. A week on from the film's release, we are delighted to share some incredible bonus footage - the educational Q&A in full.
        
        As you can see in the video below, the conversation with Helen Evans is packed with incredible insights and inspirational soundbites, as the boss explains his philosophy for developing young players.

        Must watch! Sir Alex's advice for success
        While underlining the importance of culture and history, Sir Alex speaks passionately about his own successes and failures as a manager, and how the latter shaped him the most. 
        
        “I think the history of the club tells you how we recovered from the Munich Air Disaster,” says Sir Alex. “Within 10 years we won the European Cup and, I say this to you, how many finals do you think I lost in my career?
        
        “I lost nine finals at Aberdeen and Manchester United. Nine finals! Do you know what it does? The next morning, I was a better manager. 
        
        “You have to handle defeat the correct way. To be a winner, you have to accept defeat is part of your life, but you can correct it the very next day.
        
        “All the young players here, handle defeat in the right way and make sure you are a winner the next day. I won 32 finals too [laughs]!
        
        “Actually, I can tell you every detail of all the finals I lost more than the ones I won, because it is part of my life. Losing is part of my life and it is not easy because your expectation - not just with me and my family but with the players, their families and the supporters - is to win.” </p>

        <p>During the Q&A, it is revealed that Sir Alex gave 89 youth players their senior debuts at United and, of course, that group includes some of the most decorated Reds in our history. 
        
        It also involves young men who went on to achieve success elsewhere in football, or in life, and Sir Alex is incredibly proud of his involvement. “Eighty-nine graduates? Why not 90 [laughs]?
        
        “We believed. Managers throughout the country have a really difficult problem in modern-day football because it is a results industry.
        
        “In the industry today where results matter, you have to have great belief when you play a young player, that is without question. But this club does that. Any young player that comes through has got a chance.

        From youth prospect to priest!
        “I used to say to the parents when I signed a young player, I hope we can play your boy in front of 75,000. All the time, that was my motivation for the parents, to get your boy to play in front of 75,000 people. That was the way I always was. 
         “We had some fantastic young players who became internationals and it is a joy to see it. Long may it continue and it will continue, because what I see today is exactly what I expected to see. Young boys sitting here will play for Manchester United in front of 75,000 people and it's fantastic.
